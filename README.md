 ### Strategic Alliances

<h2>Project Objective</h2>
The objective of this assignment is to identify, given a network of relationships among corporations, all relationships, subgroups, influencers, alliances, and paths to follow in the pursuit of new business relationships. I will analyze a network, which depicts various types of interorganization relationships among a large set of companies. My task is to detect potential for alliances, the impact of interlocking boards, and then attempt to identify strategic opportunities and challenges.

<br>Create a matrix representation of the network.</br>
<br>Perform initial descriptive statistics analysis, calculating the following:</br>

Analyze the matrix to detect potential for alliances.

Explain what your basis is for establishing the potential for alliances.

Pick two actors that you have identified as potential allies and perform the following:

Generate the corresponding egocentric graphs.

Calculate the density of each egocentric graph.

Calculate the centrality of each actor.

For each actor(ego), compare its density and centrality.

Calculate the betweenness centrality of each actor.

Calculate the closeness centrality of each actor.

Calculate the prestige of each actor.

For each of the metrics above, explain its meaning in the context of this particular graph.

Plot the network graph and describe the characteristics evident in the plot.

Analyze the matrix to identify the impact of interlocking boards.

Analyze the matrix to identify strategic opportunities that would benefit entities.

Point out examples of weak and strong ties within the organization and explain why they are weak or strong.

Detect structural holes and explain their impact on social closures.

Analyze the matrix to identify challenges entities may face.

Based on the analysis of this network, how do you view the impact of informal networks on the power structure of organizations?
Include an in-depth analysis of the potential for alliances, along with their effects and consequences, the impact of interlocking boards, strategic opportunities, and challenges.

Include justification for strategic decisions identified.
