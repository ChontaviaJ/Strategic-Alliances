 ### Strategic Alliances

<h2>Project Objective</h2>
The objective of this assignment is to identify, given a network of relationships among corporations, all relationships, subgroups, influencers, alliances, and paths to follow in the pursuit of new business relationships. I will analyze a network, which depicts various types of interorganization relationships among a large set of companies. My task is to detect potential for alliances, the impact of interlocking boards, and then attempt to identify strategic opportunities and challenges.
